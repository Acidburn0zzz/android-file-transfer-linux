I'm developing AFTL in my spare time and try to fix everything as fast as possible, sometimes adding features in realtime (more than 100 tickes closed by now).\r\nAny amount would help relieving pain of using MTP. :D\r\n\r\n[![Click here to lend your support to: Android File Transfer for Linux and make a donation at pledgie.com !](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/32353.png?skin_name=chrome' border='0')](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/32353)\r\n\r\n## Building instructions\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* You will need qt libraries for building ui program. If you want to use only library (*Qt is not needed*), you could turn the option ```BUILD_QT_UI``` off.\r\n* For ubuntu and other debian-based distros use the following command:\r\n\r\n  ```shell\r\n  sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libqt4-dev ninja-build libfuse-dev libreadline-dev\r\n  ```\r\n* Basically, you need `libqtX-dev` for UI, `libfuse-dev` for FUSE interface, `cmake`, `ninja` or `make` for building the project. You could use libqt5-dev as well.\r\n\r\n### Building with ninja\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake -G Ninja ..\r\nninja\r\n\r\n./qt/android-file-transfer\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Building with make\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ..\r\nmake\r\n\r\n./qt/android-file-transfer\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Building dmg package on Mac OS X\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ..\r\nmake package\r\n\r\nopen ./packages/Android\\ File\\ Transfer.dmg\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n`sudo ninja install` or `sudo make install` will install program into cmake prefix/bin directory (usually /usr/local/bin)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n### FUSE interface\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmkdir ~/my-device\r\n./aft-mtp-mount ~/my-device\r\n```\r\nRemember, if you want album art to be displayed, it must be named 'albumart.xxx' and placed *first* in the destination folder. Then copy other files.\r\nAlso, note that fuse could be 7-8 times slower than ui/cli file transfer.\r\n\r\n### QT user interface\r\n\r\n1. Start application, choose destination folder and click any button on toolbar.\r\n\r\n2. The options available there are: `Upload Album`, `Upload Directory` and `Upload Files`.\r\n   The latter two are self-explanatory. `Upload album` tries searching source directory for album cover and sets best available cover.\r\n\r\n3. You could drop any files or folders right into application window, the transfer will start automatically.\r\n\r\n### Known problems\r\n\r\n* Samsung removed android extensions from MTP, so fuse will be available readonly, sorry. Feel free to post your complaints to http://developer.samsung.com/forum/en\r\n* Sometimes downloading fails with usb timeout, then phone becomes unresponsive. [Android bug #75259](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=75259)\r\n* Objects created in UI will not show up in FUSE filesystem. [Android bug #169547](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=169547)\r\n\r\nThe actual list of all known problems and bugs available [here](https://github.com/whoozle/android-file-transfer-linux/issues)\r\n\r\n## Contacts\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions, my email address is <vladimir.menshakov@gmail.com>.\r\n\r\n## Special thanks\r\n* All who filed bugs on github and wrote emails, many features appeared only because of your feedback. Thanks!\r\n* Alexey [gazay](https://github.com/gazay) Gaziev for useful suggestions, support and invaluable help with MacBook and MacOSX port.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nAndroid File Transfer for Linux is released under [GNU GPLv3 License](https://github.com/whoozle/android-file-transfer-linux/blob/master/LICENSE).\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2015 Vladimir Menshakov\r\n",
